I just feel like this course goes too fast especially for those students who were not  able to take physics in high school. I also feel the the exams did not successful reflect the material that was being covered in class. After doing in class assignments and homework I felt like I understood the material but then when I would do a practice exam or would take the actaul exam I felt like I knew nothing. I also think it would be beneficial if there were more quizzes in this course so the material could be broken up into smaller chapters. I think it would akso be useful to consider taking a higher percentage of the recitation and homework grades or having more graded assignments for those students who do well on the homework and on the recitations but struggle when taking the exams.',1,'2022-10-10 14:47:34','2022-10-10 14:47:34'),
